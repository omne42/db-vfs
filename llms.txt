# db-vfs

DB-backed “virtual filesystem” (DB-VFS) intended for server / high-concurrency workloads.

Goals:

- Preserve the explicit safety model shape: **Policy + Secrets + Limits**.
- Provide tool-like operations: `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `write`, `patch`, `delete`.
- Support SQLite (dev/test) and Postgres (production).

This is intentionally *not* part of `safe-fs-tools` to keep that crate focused on local OS
filesystem semantics and a small dependency graph.

## Documentation

- Human docs (mdBook sources): `docs/` (build with `./scripts/docs.sh`)
- LLM/RAG bundle: `llms.txt` (regenerate with `./scripts/llms.sh`)

## Semantics

- `workspace_id` is the namespace boundary (like a “workspace root”).
- All `path`/`path_prefix` values are **root-relative**:
  - Must not start with `/`
  - Must not contain `..`
  - `path_prefix` may be empty (`""`) to mean “the whole workspace” **only if**
    `policy.permissions.allow_full_scan = true`
- Scope control (`path_prefix`):
  - `grep` requires an explicit `path_prefix` unless a safe literal prefix can be derived from
    `glob` (e.g. `"docs/**/*.md"` → `"docs/"`).
  - `glob` similarly requires `path_prefix` for broad patterns without a safe literal prefix (e.g.
    `"**/*.md"`).
- Concurrency control (`expected_version` / CAS):
  - `read` returns a `version`.
  - `patch` requires `expected_version`.
  - `write(expected_version = None)` is **create-only**; updates require `expected_version`.
  - `delete(expected_version = Some(v))` enforces CAS; `delete(expected_version = None)` is
    unconditional.

## HTTP service

By default the service requires an auth token configured in the policy file (`[auth]`), and each
token can be restricted to a workspace allowlist. For local development only, you can run with
`--unsafe-no-auth`.

Notes:

- Auth tokens:
  - Prefer storing only a hash in the policy: `sha256:<64 hex chars>`.
  - Or load a plaintext token from an environment variable: `auth.tokens[].token_env_var = "DB_VFS_TOKEN"`.
  - `--unsafe-no-auth` is restricted to loopback binds by default; use `--unsafe-no-auth-allow-non-loopback` only if you fully understand the risk.
- Request tracing uses `x-request-id`:
  - If the client sets it, the service echoes it back.
  - Otherwise the service generates one and returns it in the response headers.
- Concurrency and pooling are controlled by policy `limits`:
  - `max_concurrency_io` (read/write/patch/delete)
  - `max_concurrency_scan` (glob/grep)
  - `max_db_connections` (SQLite/Postgres pool size)
  - `max_io_ms` (service timeout for read/write/patch/delete; also used for Postgres `statement_timeout`)
- Rate limiting is controlled by policy `limits`:
  - `max_requests_per_ip_per_sec`
  - `max_requests_burst_per_ip`
  - Note: the limiter uses the TCP peer address (it does not parse `x-forwarded-for`), so configure it appropriately when running behind a reverse proxy.
- Scan traversal skipping is controlled by policy `traversal`:
  - `traversal.skip_globs` (performance only; does not deny direct access)
- Timeout semantics:
  - Timeouts are best-effort wall-clock budgets at the service layer.
  - Timeouts include time spent waiting for the service concurrency semaphores; under sustained load a request may fail with `503 busy` rather than wait indefinitely.
  - For SQLite, the service attempts to interrupt in-flight queries on timeout; for Postgres, `statement_timeout` is configured.
  - A timed-out request may still return early while some cleanup continues briefly in the background.
- Secrets are denied by default (e.g. `.env`, `.git/**`, `.ssh/**`, `.aws/**`, `.kube/**`, `.omne_agent_data/**`); adjust `policy.secrets` if needed.

### SQLite

Run:

```bash
cd db-vfs
cargo run -p db-vfs-service -- \
  --sqlite ./db-vfs.sqlite \
  --policy ./policy.example.toml \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Postgres

Run (requires building with `postgres` enabled):

```bash
cd db-vfs
cargo run -p db-vfs-service --features postgres -- \
  --postgres "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db_vfs" \
  --policy ./policy.example.toml \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Endpoints (JSON POST):

- `/v1/read`
- `/v1/write`
- `/v1/patch`
- `/v1/delete`
- `/v1/glob`
- `/v1/grep`

Minimal example:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/write \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ${DB_VFS_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"workspace_id":"w1","path":"docs/a.txt","content":"hello","expected_version":null}'

curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/grep \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ${DB_VFS_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"workspace_id":"w1","query":"hello","regex":false,"glob":"docs/**/*.txt","path_prefix":null}'
```

## Development

Run gates (fmt/check/clippy/test):

```bash
./scripts/gate.sh
```

Enable git hooks:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath githooks
```

The hooks enforce Conventional Commits and require `CHANGELOG.md` updates. The Rust file size guard
can be overridden via `DB_VFS_MAX_RS_LINES=<N>`.

# Security

## Threat model

`db-vfs` is a library + HTTP service for performing virtual filesystem operations against a
database-backed store with an explicit, caller-provided policy (`VfsPolicy`).

It enforces policy checks in-process. It is designed for *trusted* deployments (e.g. internal
services) where you still want strong, explicit guardrails.

## Not an OS sandbox

This project does **not** provide OS-level isolation. If you need strong isolation, run the service
inside an OS sandbox / container / VM and apply network controls.

## Auth & secrets

- The service requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` by default.
- Prefer storing only `sha256:<64 hex>` token hashes in committed policy files.
- For plaintext tokens, use `auth.tokens[].token_env_var` so secrets live in the process environment.
- `--unsafe-no-auth` is restricted to loopback binds by default; using it on a public interface is
  dangerous.

Secrets are mitigated via:

- Path deny rules (`policy.secrets.deny_globs`) to block direct access.
- Regex redaction (`policy.secrets.redact_regexes`) applied to `read`/`grep` output.

## Resource limits & DoS

Policy limits bound work and memory:

- Request sizes: `max_read_bytes`, `max_write_bytes`, `max_patch_bytes`.
- Scan bounds: `max_walk_entries`, `max_walk_files`, `max_walk_ms`, `max_results`.
- Service concurrency: `max_concurrency_io`, `max_concurrency_scan`, `max_db_connections`.
- Service timeouts: `max_io_ms` (plus Postgres `statement_timeout` when enabled).
- Per-IP rate limiting: `max_requests_per_ip_per_sec`, `max_requests_burst_per_ip`,
  `max_rate_limit_ips`.

These are best-effort safeguards, not a replacement for OS-level limits and network-level
mitigations (load balancers, WAF, reverse proxy rate limits, etc.).

## Timeout semantics

Service-layer timeouts return early to the client, but the underlying blocking DB operation may
continue briefly in the background. For SQLite, the service attempts to interrupt in-flight queries
on timeout; for Postgres, `statement_timeout` is configured. Treat timeouts as a *budgeting* and
*backpressure* mechanism, not a hard cancel.

## Path probing side-channels

If untrusted callers can control `path` inputs and observe detailed errors/timing, they may be able
to infer information about stored paths (existence, deny rules, etc.).

If this matters, reduce observable error detail, enforce rate limits, and run behind an API gateway.

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, please open an issue with:

- Minimal reproduction
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Rust toolchain, DB backend)

# db-vfs

`db-vfs` is a DB-backed “virtual filesystem” (VFS) intended for server / high-concurrency workloads.

It provides tool-like operations with explicit safety policy enforcement:

- `read` (optional line ranges)
- `glob`
- `grep`
- `write`
- `patch` (unified diff)
- `delete`

This repo contains:

- `db-vfs` (crate): core VFS operations backed by a `Store` trait.
- `db-vfs-service` (crate): an HTTP JSON service (Axum) with auth, request limits, and concurrency control.

Non-goals:

- Full git-repo tooling (checkout/build, etc).
- Large binary file storage.
- Unbounded traversal/search (scans are scoped and budgeted).

## Where to start

- New users: [`Getting started`](getting-started.md)
- Understanding semantics: [`Concepts`](concepts.md)
- Configuration: [`Policy`](policy.md) and [`policy.example.toml`](../../policy.example.toml)
- Integrating over HTTP: [`HTTP API`](http-api.md)
- LLM/RAG ingestion: [`llms.txt`](llms.md)


---
file: docs/src/getting-started.md
---

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (see `rust-toolchain.toml`)

## Run the service (SQLite)

Create a policy file (start from `policy.example.toml`) and set a bearer token at runtime:

```bash
export DB_VFS_TOKEN='dev-token-change-me'
```

Run:

```bash
cargo run -p db-vfs-service -- \
  --sqlite ./db-vfs.sqlite \
  --policy ./policy.example.toml \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Smoke test

Write a file:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/write \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ${DB_VFS_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"workspace_id":"w1","path":"docs/a.txt","content":"hello","expected_version":null}'
```

Read it back:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/read \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ${DB_VFS_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"workspace_id":"w1","path":"docs/a.txt","start_line":null,"end_line":null}'
```


---
file: docs/src/concepts.md
---

# Concepts

## Namespace: `workspace_id`

`workspace_id` is the namespace boundary. All operations are scoped to:

- `workspace_id`
- a root-relative `path` or `path_prefix`

## Root-relative paths

All `path` / `path_prefix` values are root-relative:

- Must not start with `/`
- Must not contain `..`

`path_prefix` may be empty (`""`) to mean “the whole workspace” **only if**
`policy.permissions.allow_full_scan = true`.

## Safety policy

The policy is validated on load and governs:

- Which operations are permitted (`permissions`)
- How much work each request can do (`limits`)
- Which paths are denied or redacted (`secrets`)
- Which paths are skipped during scans only (`traversal`)
- Service auth tokens and workspace allowlists (`auth`)

## Concurrency and CAS

Writes are guarded by optimistic concurrency using a monotonically increasing `version`:

- `read` returns the current `version`
- `write(expected_version = null)` is **create-only**
- `write(expected_version = v)` updates iff the current version is `v`
- `patch` requires `expected_version`
- `delete(expected_version = v)` enforces CAS; `delete(expected_version = null)` is unconditional

## Scan scoping

To avoid unbounded traversal, scan operations are scoped:

- `grep` requires an explicit `path_prefix` unless a safe literal prefix can be derived from `glob`
- `glob` similarly requires `path_prefix` for broad patterns without a safe literal prefix

## Error codes

Library errors carry stable `code`s (e.g. `invalid_path`, `not_permitted`, `conflict`, `timeout`).
The HTTP service maps these to HTTP status codes and returns a JSON error body.


---
file: docs/src/policy.md
---

# Policy

The service loads a policy file (`.toml` or `.json`) into `db_vfs_core::policy::VfsPolicy`.

Start from `policy.example.toml`.

## Sections

### `[permissions]`

Toggles operations on/off:

- `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `write`, `patch`, `delete`
- `allow_full_scan`: allow `path_prefix=""` for `glob`/`grep`

### `[auth]` / `[[auth.tokens]]`

The HTTP service requires:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Each token is restricted to a workspace allowlist (`allowed_workspaces`):

- exact: `"ws1"`
- prefix: `"team1-*"`
- all: `"*"`

Tokens can be provided as:

- `token = "sha256:<64 hex chars>"` (recommended for committed policies)
- `token_env_var = "DB_VFS_TOKEN"` (load plaintext token at runtime)

### `[limits]`

Budgets to control CPU/memory/DB load, including:

- request sizes: `max_read_bytes`, `max_write_bytes`, `max_patch_bytes`
- scan budgets: `max_walk_entries`, `max_walk_files`, `max_walk_ms`, `max_results`
- service: `max_io_ms`, `max_concurrency_io`, `max_concurrency_scan`, `max_db_connections`
- rate limiting: `max_requests_per_ip_per_sec`, `max_requests_burst_per_ip`, `max_rate_limit_ips`

### `[secrets]`

Controls deny rules and text redaction:

- `deny_globs`: deny direct access to matching paths
- `redact_regexes`: applied to returned text
- `replacement`: string used to replace redacted matches

### `[traversal]`

Scan-only skipping rules:

- `skip_globs`: skipped during `glob`/`grep` traversal (performance only; does not deny direct reads)


---
file: docs/src/http-api.md
---

# HTTP API

The service exposes JSON POST endpoints:

- `/v1/read`
- `/v1/write`
- `/v1/patch`
- `/v1/delete`
- `/v1/glob`
- `/v1/grep`

All requests require:

- `content-type: application/json`
- `authorization: Bearer <token>` (unless started with `--unsafe-no-auth`)

## Errors

Errors are returned as JSON with an HTTP status code:

```json
{ "code": "invalid_path", "message": "..." }
```

5xx errors use a non-leaky `"internal error"` message.

## Tracing

- The service accepts and returns `x-request-id`.
- If missing, it generates one and includes it on the response.


---
file: docs/src/storage.md
---

# Storage backends

## SQLite

- Intended for dev/test and single-node deployments.
- Uses `r2d2_sqlite` for connection pooling.
- The service attempts to interrupt in-flight SQLite queries on timeout (best-effort).

## Postgres

- Intended for production deployments (build with `--features postgres`).
- Uses `r2d2_postgres` for connection pooling.
- The service configures Postgres `statement_timeout` based on policy `limits.max_io_ms`.

## Migrations

Migrations live under `migrations/` and are applied on startup:

- `migrations/sqlite/`
- `migrations/postgres/`

file: docs/src/security.md

# Security

See `SECURITY.md` for the threat model and guidance.

Key points:

- Root-relative path normalization rejects `/`-absolute paths and `..` segments.
- Secret deny rules apply to direct access; redaction applies to returned text.
- `glob`/`grep` require scoping (`path_prefix`) unless explicitly allowed.
- Auth is required by default; `--unsafe-no-auth` is intended for local development only.
- The rate limiter uses the TCP peer IP and does not parse `x-forwarded-for`.


---
file: docs/src/observability.md
---

# Observability

## `x-request-id`

The service:

- Echoes `x-request-id` if provided by the client.
- Otherwise generates one and adds it to the response headers.

## Logging

The service uses `tracing`; configure via `RUST_LOG`, for example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=db_vfs_service=info cargo run -p db-vfs-service -- --sqlite ./db.sqlite --policy ./policy.example.toml
```


---
file: docs/src/troubleshooting.md
---

# Troubleshooting

## `401 unauthorized`

- Missing or invalid `Authorization` header.
- Token does not match any configured auth rule.

## `403 forbidden`

- Workspace is not allowed for the current token.
- Operation is disabled by policy.

## `408 timeout`

- Request exceeded the configured wall-clock timeout budget.
- For SQLite, the service attempts to interrupt in-flight queries (best-effort).

## `413 payload too large`

- Request exceeded `limits.max_read_bytes` / `max_write_bytes` / `max_patch_bytes`.

## `503 busy`

- The service is at its configured concurrency limit.
